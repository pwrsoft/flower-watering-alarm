* Flower Watering Alarm

- detect sunrise (rising light level: 0 -> 1 && speed of change > K)
- defer notifications for N hours after detected sunrise
- time sync internal clock at 00:00
- reset button - gives alive status audio feedback
- measure solar accumulated energy
- measure accumulated water consumption/presence (soil resistance)
- add audio notifications for under/over solar/water levels/total presence
- add flexible deep sleep time (for event-triggered notifications, etc.)
- use EEPROM for stats storage (solar energy, water levels, watering periods, etc.)
- add changing desired soil resitance alarm trigger value (EEPROM)
